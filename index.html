    <h2>The Coming Wave</h2>
    
    <h3>Prologue</h3>
    <p>"From where we stand today, it seems that containing this wave—that is, controlling it, slowing it down, or even stopping it—is not possible. This book asks why that might be true and what it means if it is. The implications of these questions will ultimately affect everyone who lives and every generation that follows."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 1: Containment Is Not Possible</h3>
    <p>"I believe this coming technological wave is bringing human history to a turning point. If containment is impossible, the consequences for our species are dramatic, potentially terrible. Equally, without its fruits, we are exposed and precarious. This is an argument I have presented many times behind closed doors over the past decade, but as the impacts become increasingly undeniable, it is time to present the case publicly."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 2: Endless Proliferation</h3>
    <p>"So, what is a wave? Put simply, a wave is a set of technologies coming together around the same time, powered by one or several new general-purpose technologies with profound societal implications. By 'general-purpose technologies,' I mean those that enable seismic advances in what human beings can do. Society unfolds in concert with these leaps. We see it over and over; a new piece of technology, like the internal combustion engine, proliferates and transforms everything around it."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 3: The Containment Problem</h3>
    <p>"Have we ever really tried this, have we ever tried to contain a wave? Have we ever said no? When the printing press roared across Europe in the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire had a very different response. It tried to ban it. Unhappy with the prospect of mass, unregulated production of knowledge and culture, the Sultan considered the press a foreign, 'Western' innovation."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 4: The Technology of Intelligence</h3>
    <p>"Most of the coverage of The Coming Wave has focused on what it has to say about artificial intelligence, which makes sense given that it is one of the most important books ever written about AI. And there is probably no one more qualified than Mustafa to write it. He was there in 2016 when DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated the world's best Go players..."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 5: The Technology of Life</h3>
    <p>"But what sets his book apart from others is Mustafa's insight that AI is just one part of an unprecedented convergence of scientific advancements. Genetic editing, DNA synthesis, and other breakthroughs in biotechnology are rapidly advancing in parallel."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 6: The Wider Wave</h3>
    <p>"As the title suggests, these changes are accumulating like a wave far out at sea, invisible to many but gaining strength. Each would be transformative on its own; together, they are about to reshape every aspect of society."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 7: Four Features of the Coming Wave</h3>
    <p>"These waves of technology and innovation are at the heart of this book. More importantly, they are at the heart of human history. Understand these complex, chaotic, and cumulative waves, and the challenge of containment becomes clear. Understand their history, and we can begin to outline their future."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 8: Unstoppable Incentives</h3>
    <p>"If I had a magic button that could slow all of this down for 30 or 40 years while humanity figures out trust and common goals, I might press it. But that button does not exist. These technologies will be created regardless of what any individual or company does."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 9: The Grand Bargain</h3>
    <p>"At its core, the nation-state, the central unit of today’s global political order, offers its citizens a simple and highly persuasive bargain: not only is the centralization of power in the sovereign, territorial state possible, but its benefits far outweigh the risks."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 10: Fragility Amplifiers</h3>
    <p>"But there is a problem. States are already under enormous pressure, and the coming wave appears to be making things much more complicated. The consequences of this collision will shape the rest of the century."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 11: The Future of Nations</h3>
    <p>"If you accept even a small part of this book’s central argument, the real question is what to do about it. Once we have acknowledged this reality, what will actually make a difference? Faced with a dilemma like the one I have outlined in the first three parts of this book, what could containment look like, even in theory?"</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 12: The Dilemma</h3>
    <p>"Containment is, at first glance, not possible. And yet, for the good of all, containment must be possible."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 13: Containment Must Be Possible</h3>
    <p>"Earlier in the book, I described containment as a foundation for controlling and governing technology, encompassing technical, cultural, and regulatory aspects. Essentially, I believe this means having the power to drastically reduce or completely stop the negative impacts of technology, from the local and small-scale to the planetary and existential."</p>
    
    <h3>Chapter 14: Ten Steps Toward Containment</h3>
    <p>"Think of the ten ideas presented here as concentric circles. We start small and direct, close to the technology, focusing on specific mechanisms to impose restrictions by design. From there, each idea becomes progressively broader, ascending a ladder of interventions moving away from hard technical details, code, and raw materials, and toward non-technical but equally important actions..."</p>
